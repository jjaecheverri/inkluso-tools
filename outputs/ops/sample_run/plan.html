  <h1 class="article-h1">When the Competitor Opens Two Blocks Away</h1>
  <p class="article-deck">A diagnosis and three-track intervention plan for a restaurant operator in Bentonville facing a 40% lunch cover decline after competitive entry.</p>

  <div class="article-body">

    <div class="article-section-tag">/DIAGNOSIS</div>
    <h2 class="article-h2">Problem Summary</h2>
    <p>A Bentonville restaurant operating in the $5k–$20k monthly revenue range reports a 40% decline in lunch covers following the opening of a direct competitor within 200 meters. Food cost is currently at 38% of revenue. The operator cannot absorb a price reduction without margin collapse. Primary pressure: competition, secondary constraint: margin.</p>

    <h2 class="article-h2">Mechanism</h2>
    <p>The cover decline is not purely attributable to the competitor's existence. At 38% food cost, this operator was already margin-constrained before competitive entry — meaning the buffer to absorb demand volatility was thin. The competitor did not create the problem; it exposed it. The underlying mechanism is a pricing structure that optimized for volume at the expense of resilience. A 40% volume drop on a thin-margin model produces a disproportionate cash impact.</p>
    <p>The strategic question is not "how do we get those covers back." It is: <em>"What is this business actually good at that the new competitor cannot replicate easily?"</em></p>

    <h2 class="article-h2">Constraints</h2>
    <ul style="color: var(--gray); padding-left: 1.25rem; line-height: 2; font-size: 0.95rem;">
      <li>No price reduction available without margin collapse</li>
      <li>Monthly revenue in $5k–$20k range limits capital-heavy interventions</li>
      <li>90-day time horizon requires fast, low-cost moves first</li>
      <li>Risk tolerance: medium (measured bets)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="article-section-tag green">/TRACK A — Low-capital</div>
    <div class="plan-block track-a">
      <h3>Compress the Menu, Own a Time Slot</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce lunch menu to 5–7 high-margin items. Remove lowest-margin dishes.</li>
        <li>Target one underserved time slot the competitor doesn't own (early lunch 11–12, late lunch 1:30–3, or pre-dinner).</li>
        <li>Build a $12–$15 lunch special that communicates value without discounting.</li>
        <li>Measure: food cost % after menu reduction (target: from 38% to 32–34%).</li>
        <li>Reversibility: HIGH. Menu changes can be reversed within days.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="article-section-tag">/TRACK B — Structural</div>
    <div class="plan-block track-b">
      <h3>Build a Repeat Customer Layer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Launch a simple punch card or digital loyalty program targeting regulars, not new customers.</li>
        <li>Identify top 20% of covers by frequency — these are the business. Map what they order and when.</li>
        <li>Create a reason for them to return specifically for lunch: a weekly rotating item, a standing reservation, a priority order window.</li>
        <li>Measure: weekly repeat cover rate (baseline vs 60-day target).</li>
        <li>Reversibility: MEDIUM. Loyalty program creates expectations — exit carefully if needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="article-section-tag lilac">/TRACK C — Defensive</div>
    <div class="plan-block track-c">
      <h3>Shift Revenue Mix Away from Lunch</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If lunch covers remain depressed after 45 days: shift kitchen capacity toward dinner or catering.</li>
        <li>Bentonville's corporate ecosystem (Walmart, suppliers, agencies) generates consistent catering demand — explore 3–5 direct outreach calls to local offices.</li>
        <li>A single corporate lunch contract at $800–$1,200/event replaces 40+ covers with one decision.</li>
        <li>Measure: catering revenue as % of total (target: 15% within 90 days).</li>
        <li>Reversibility: HIGH for initial outreach. LOW if kitchen operations are restructured for catering.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="article-section-tag">/METRICS</div>
    <h2 class="article-h2">What to Watch</h2>
    <ul style="color: var(--gray); padding-left: 1.25rem; line-height: 2; font-size: 0.95rem;">
      <li>Food cost % — weekly. Target: below 35% within 30 days of menu compression.</li>
      <li>Lunch cover count — daily. Baseline now. Compare week-over-week.</li>
      <li>Repeat customer rate — bi-weekly. Track how many covers are first-visit vs return.</li>
      <li>Revenue per cover — weekly. Price compression will show here first.</li>
      <li>Catering revenue — monthly. Leading indicator for Track C viability.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="irreversible-step">
      <div class="step-label">First Irreversible Step</div>
      <p>Cut the menu. Identify the 3 lowest-margin lunch items and remove them this week. This is the only move that immediately improves your structural position without spending money or making external commitments. Everything else follows from here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="evidence-box" style="border-left-color: var(--lilac);">
      <h4 style="color: var(--lilac);">Risks and Assumptions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assumption:</strong> The 40% cover decline is primarily attributable to competitive entry, not seasonal variation or unrelated factors (e.g., parking, reviews).</li>
        <li><strong>Assumption:</strong> Regulars are currently returning at a rate that can be measured and acted on.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Menu compression may disappoint existing customers expecting prior options. Communicate changes directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Catering pivot requires operational capacity not currently deployed. Do not pursue Track C until Track A shows results.</li>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> This plan does not constitute legal or financial advice. Consult a licensed accountant before restructuring cost categories or cash allocation.</li>
      </ul>
