scope_limits:
  - "Analysis covers operational and demand-side interventions only."
  - "Revenue projections are directional benchmarks, not financial forecasts."
  - "No legal or tax advice is provided. Regulatory references are directional; operator must verify with Arkansas Department of Health."
  - "Plan does not account for personal financial obligations of the operator."

assumptions:
  - id: A1
    statement: "Product quality is not the primary constraint"
    basis: "Operator framed the problem as profitability and consistency, not product performance"
    confidence: medium
  - id: A2
    statement: "Current operation falls within Arkansas cottage food law limits"
    basis: "Revenue range and market-only distribution are consistent with cottage food parameters"
    confidence: medium
    flag: "Must be verified before B2B wholesale outreach"
  - id: A3
    statement: "Bentonville farmers market operates weekly with consistent foot traffic"
    confidence: high
  - id: A4
    statement: "At least one local B2B account is accessible without cold outreach infrastructure"
    confidence: medium

uncertainty_notes:
  - "Pre-order adoption rate is variable; 20 orders/week at day 30 is optimistic without an existing email list"
  - "B2B wholesale pricing at 60-65% of retail assumes retail prices are already at market rate"
  - "Seasonal demand data not independently verified for this run"

safety_notes:
  - "No guaranteed outcomes are stated or implied"
  - "The first irreversible step is low-cost and reversible; all higher-commitment actions are gated behind validation checkpoints"
  - "The B2B track includes an explicit regulatory compliance gate"
  - "This plan does not constitute financial, legal, or medical advice"
