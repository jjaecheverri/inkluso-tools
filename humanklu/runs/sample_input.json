  "title": "The Hidden Cost of Cheap Lithium: Why EV Battery Supply Chains Are More Fragile Than Analysts Admit",
  "topic": "Electric Vehicles / Supply Chain Risk",
  "summary": "Mainstream projections for electric vehicle adoption systematically underestimate the geopolitical and physical constraints on lithium carbonate supply. Three converging pressures—Chilean water litigation, Chinese refining concentration, and geological grade decline in major deposits—create a 2027–2029 supply window that could slow EV rollout by 18–24 months in key Western markets. This report examines each mechanism, decodes the incentives suppressing public risk disclosure, and quantifies the realistic downside scenarios.",
